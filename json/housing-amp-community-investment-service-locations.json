The Department also to issues rent registration certificates to rental properties that have paid their rent registration fees.  Rent Escrow Account Program (REAP): REAP enforces compliance with the Housing code, and encourages property owners to maintain their properties by entitling tenants of units with unresolved violations to reduced rent rates, and providing them the option to deposit their reduced rents into a City-managed escrow account.  These funds can be withdrawn for different purposes authorized by the Ordinance. UMP: UMP is an enforcement program that allows tenants to continue to receive essential utility services. Through UMP, the Department of Water and Power (DWP) and the Gas Company refer delinquent master-metered properties subject to rent stabilization to HCIDLA to establish escrow accounts for tenants to voluntarily deposit their rent.  HCIDLA is then able to release these funds to maintain utility services for the affected tenants.    "
